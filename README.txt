This document is souly for the purpose of explaining the extension

The extension which you are now exploring transmits data between the following sites:
http://www.die2nite.com/
http://atlas.wonderfulfailure.com/
http://d2n.sindevel.com/oo/

As this site is only loosely affiliated with all three of these websites, you, the user,
should consult these sites when curious about how your data is stored on them.

This addon is to make die2nite.com more playable, by adding access to advanced maps.
If for any reason, you do not want your in game data posted on these websites,
you should not use this addon.

However, this might be a bad idea for your town...
